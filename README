This is a research project in cosmology and machine learning. The goal is to learn the velocity distributions within dark matter halos using support vector regression. I am receiving course credit via the Machine Learning class 10-602, Independent Study: Research at Carnegie Mellon University.

My work is supervised by:

   Shirley Ho (Assistant Professor, Physics) - shirleyh@andrew.cmu.edu
   Jeff Schneider (Associate Research Professor, Robotics Institute / School of Computer Science) - jeff.schneider@cs.cmu.edu

I make use of dark matter N-body simulations made by Hy Trac (Assistant Professor, Physics) - hytrac@cmu.edu.
The halos were extracted by Michelle Ntampaka (graduate student, Physics) - cmhicks@andrew.cmu.edu.

My contributions:

   parse_halos.py - Python script to parse N-body binary output file describing halos 
   parse_particles.py - Python script to parse N-body binary output file describing individual particles
   constants.py - Relevant constants, including scientific quantities, simulation parameters, and named indices for use with parsed data     		      
   velocity.py - Python script to learn the velocity distributions. Run "python velocity.py -h True" for more details.
